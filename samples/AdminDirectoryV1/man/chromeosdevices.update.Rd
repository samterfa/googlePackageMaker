\arguments{
\item{deviceId}{The unique ID of the device. The \code{deviceId}s are returned in the response from the \href{/admin-sdk/v1/reference/chromeosdevices/list}{chromeosdevices.list} method.}

\item{customerId}{The unique ID for the customer's G Suite account. As an account administrator, you can also use the \code{my_customer} alias to represent your account's \code{customerId}. The \code{customerId} is also returned as part of the \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/reference/users}{Users resource}.}

\item{projection}{Restrict information returned to a set of selected fields.}

\item{orgUnitPath}{The full parent path with the organizational unit's name associated with the device. Path names are case insensitive. If the parent organizational unit is the top-level organization, it is represented as a forward slash, \code{/}. This property can be \href{/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-chrome-devices#update_chrome_device}{updated} using the API. For more information about how to create an organizational structure for your device, see the \href{http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?answer=182433}{administration help center}.}

\item{systemRamTotal}{Total RAM on the device \link{in bytes} (Read-only)}

\item{status}{The status of the device.}
